# python-challenge
This small program demonstrates my developing ability to sort through larger databases in a csv file.
In it I sorted information from a banks profits and losses throughout the years as well as the results of an election. 
With my code you can see how I extracted information from the large database such as the changes from one row to another and the average in that change. 
In addition from this project I've learned how to locate the corresponding values from that change, which in this case was used to find the Date of the 
change.
This code has been the most complex I've created so far, especially when it came to finding the correlated change from the profit/losses in PyBank. 
Extracting basic math formulas from the PyPoll proved to be much easier as most of the coding required simple math formulas like adding and dividing. 
By far the most valuable thing I learned from this project was how to export this information into a concise text file.
